USAGE:  spcsac [option]
-v:            If you are so lucky, you can see the version
               of this software :-) otherwise...: quotes and unquotes...
-a:            ASCII output for non-SAC-users.
-h:            If you want to call help file (this text).
-e:            If you want to work in a prompt mode rather than
               in a commandline mode.
-l LSMOOTH:    Smoothness parameter LSMOOTH has to be determined.
               If you want to know appropriate lsmooth for your
               expected sampling frequency,
               you can calculate with this spcsac software:
               %spcsac -t
-i:            In order to obtain appropriate lsmooth, spcsac will
               help you to calculate the value.
-H SAMPLINGHZ: If you put Sampling Hz value, spcsac will automatically
               calculate the appropriate LSMOOTH value.
-d DIRECTORY:  All spc files in DIRECTORY will be transformed.
               default: (./)
-f FILE:       One specified spc FILE only will be transformed.
-p/-s STRINGS: In order to discriminate PSV or SH spc files,
               you have to put common strings back in the file names.
               (default: psv.spc and sh.spc
-c RTZ:        You can choose which component to be transformed.
               (R/T/Z)               (default: RTZ)
-m MODE:       You can choose PSV/SH channel. (SH/PSV, sh/psv) (default: PSVSH)
-r/-t/-z STR:  In order to discriminate radial/transverse/vertical
               component output sac files, you have to put common
               strings back in the file names. (default: .Rs/.Ts/.Zs)

If you do not put any options, you are to transform all set of
 PSV and SH scp files named "xxxxxxpsv.spc" and "xxxxxxsh.spc"
 in current working directory. LSMOOTH is set as 4.
In addition to that, you will obtain complete seismograms
named "xxxxxx.Rs" something.

EXAMPLES:
	spcsac -l 8 -mPSV -ppsv.spc_tmp -cZT -t .transverse.sac

You can also check README.pdf in the spcsac directory.
